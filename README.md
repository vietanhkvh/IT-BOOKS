# The clean code

## What is this?

This is multi-month study plan for reading The "Clean code" book and taking note the important things which everyone should remember about it. About the book, it is a usefull and reading easy for everyone. The author write it by telling story, so it isn't academic.

My main goal was coding better and sharing what I leart from the book after reading. When I wrote this respositrosi, I was a student in three years and hoped boosting my code level.

Hope you enjoying and feeling free to make it better.

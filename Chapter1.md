## There will be code
* The code will change on day by day, nothing can replace code.
* The code will never die because code is the language or way which people talk to computer or machine by.
## Bad code
* Remember Lebanc's law: Later will never. Fix and note your code when ever you need.
* The bad code can bring a company down
## A total cost of owning a mess
* The coding speed degree of your team or your project will be decrease. Day by day, the mess will become massive and can be resovled.
### 1. The grand redesign in the sky
* It make the manager start creating a special team. They are the best coder to develop a new system base on the old one. But it take a long time, maybe 10 years or more. So, always keep your code clean.
### 2. Attitude
* You are the project developer. If you know what is the best for the project, will not allow everyone change the direction. 
* You have to talk to your manganer clearly that what necessary things you have to do in the project. And you have to do it even it will take time more than the planing time. Don't bend to the will of manager.
### 3. The primal connumdrum
* The only way to make the deadline—the only way to go fast—is to keep the code as clean as possible at all times.
### 4. The art of clean code
* Knowing how to code cleanly is the art. You have to pracise a lot of time.
Like a painter draws pictures day by day util he get "draw scence" which become a part of him.
###5. What is clean code?
We talk too much about clean code, but what is exactly clean code? We will read the answer of many programmer who is very well-known for this question.
Firsttly, Bjarne Stroustrup, inventor of C++ and author of The C++ Programming Language.
"_I like my code to be elegant and efficient. The logic should be straightforward to make it hard for bugs to hide, the dependencies minimal to ease maintenance, error handling complete
according to an articulated strategy, and performance close to optimal so as not to tempt people to make the code messy with unprincipled optimizations. Clean code does one thing well._"  
What we got after read the Bjarne's answer.
* Clean code is elegant, pleasing and efficiency.
According to Grady Booch, author of Object, Oriented Analysis and Design with Applications, clean code is simple and direct. It like well-written prose.
Anything else?
* Bad code tempt the mess to grow. When orther change bad code, they tend to make it worse.
Then, we have the answer of Pragmatic Dave Thomas and Andy Hunt. They said that a program with bad code like a building with broken windows. It make nobody care about it. Then, they stop caring bout it and break them. One broken window will starts the process toward decay
And the best coder always attention to detail. So what show that? It is clean code. For example, when you clean the floor, you can't miss any hidden space. It show that you are unprofestional.
